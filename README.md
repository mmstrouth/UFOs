# UFOs

## Overview of the Project
Dana, a data journalist, initially created an interactive website that allowed visitors to filter UFO sightings by date to accompany her article. She wanted to provide visitors to the site an opportunity to draw their own conclusions to the question, "UFO Sightings: Fact or Fancy?" The purpose of this project was to add additional filtering criteria which allows the visitor to search by any combination of date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
To use the new and improved filters, a user can choose any combination of date, city, state, country, and shape. 

Site visitors could also choose to search by just one of the filters. The screenshot below shows the data filtered by shape.

Site visitors could choose to search by two of the criteria. The screenshot below shows the data filtered by state and shape.

Here is an example of the data filtered by three criteria: date, state, and shape.

## Summary
The new design allows for more customized searching which can be a possible drawback. Visitors to the site may become frustrated if they do not see results if their criteria is too limited or too specific. 
To make the site more user-friendly, I recommend two adjustments:
1. Make the date criteria by month and year or just by year. Users may not know a specific day to search for and by broadening the criteria, they may see better results.
2. "Shape" is a challenging criteria because the visitor to the site may not even know what the options are. I recommend a drop down menu of options that would make it clear to the user what shapes they can search by.
